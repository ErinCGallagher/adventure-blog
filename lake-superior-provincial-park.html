            <h2>A Quick Hike Before the Park!</h2>
            
            <div class="post-content-body">
              <p>I know i'm starting off a a blog post about Lake Superior Provincial Park with another provincial park but they are very close to one another so bear with me :)</p>
              <p>After arriving late Thursday night in Sault Ste. Marie, my girlfriend's and I were eager to start hiking bright and early Friday morning! After all, we had been trapped in tiny Toronto
                condos all summer so what could be more exciting and different from our regular day to day! After about a 50 minute drive from our hotel, the Quattro hotel in Sault Ste. Marie, we arrived at Pancake Bay Provincial Park. 
                Located across highway 17 from the campground is the start of <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/pancakebay/activities" target="_blank">The Lookout Trail</a>.
                This trail is known for it's panoramic view of Lake Superior and Pancake Bay and I can confirm that we were not disappointed. The hike itself is was pretty easy but I suggest
                wearing closed toe shoes because there are a lot of exposed rocks and roots. Once you get to the end of the trail there are about 4 flights of steep stairs which take you to the 2
                lookout platforms. We did the trail first in the morning and only came across 1 or 2 other groups of hikers so we had the lookouts all to ourselves! I would highly recommend 
                this trail as a start for your trip because it gives you a great sense of just how big Lake Superior really is.

              <h2>Lunch Time Already? ðŸ¤¤</h2>
              <p>We may have only just started our trip but we knew how important a good meal was going to be after a great hike!
                Although the <a href="https://buyalgoma.ca/agawa-fish-chips" target="_blank">Agawa Fish & Chips </a> truck doesn't look like anything special on the outside, they made our favourite fish and chips on the trip. 
                Yes, this wasn't our last fish and chips stop. The fish is locally caught Lake Trout and whitefish and battered to perfection. Not too thick
                but not too thin! Their tartar sauce is also amazing, and this is coming from someone who generally just goes with ketchup.

            <h2>Agawa Rock Pictographs</h2>
            <p>Now that we had avoided becoming hangry it was time to explore one of <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/lakesuperior/activities" target="_blank">Canada's most visited indigenous archaeological sites</a>. 
              The Ojibwe people's paintings can be viewed by boat or by hike, but we decided on hiking as the large parking lot is right at the trailhead. The short hike
              takes you to a large rock face along the lake which holds the 17th and 18th century paintings. There are chains hooked into the rock which allow visitors
              to climb the rock face without falling into the lake. This is only a 1 way path though so we had to wait at the stairs for 10 minutes while other visitors viewed
              the paintings. They did have warnings up warning that large waves can pull people into the water so I would suggest picking a calm day.</p>

        <h2>Backcountry Camping along Gargantua Bay</h2>
        <p>After a jam packed first day, by around 3:30pm we were ready to find our campsite. Lake Superior Provincial Park has 2 car camping campgrounds, Rabbit Blanket Lake & Agawa Bay,
          but we decided to take a stab at backcountry camping along <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/lakesuperior/camping" target="_blank">Gargantua Bay</a>. To get the the parking 
          for the sites it's a 24 -35 minute drive, depending on how fast you go, down a winding bumpy gravel road. We encountered other cars along the way but there is no genrally no issue passing except 
          for the 1 lane bridge. The road is very well maintained considering it's a gravel/small Rock road. We were shocked that there were barely any pot holes. At the end of the road there is one parking area, 
          ~7 cars, at the start of the path to the north campsite. If you drive 50m further there is a second larger parking area that can fit ~10 cars at the start of the path to the south campsite. The 
          parking lot was shockingly full the entire time we were there but we managed to squeeze our Ford Expedition into a small spot. 
          </p>

          <p><b>Tip:</b> Arrive early if you want to guarantee you get a backcountry site that is close to the parking lot. Since backcountry sites are on a first come first serve basis, you are not 
            guaranteed a spot right along the Bay as the permit area is much larger than that. When we left at 10:15am the next morning we came across
            3 vehicles filled with backcountry gear. I suggest arriving for 9:30am and waiting for campers to leave.</p>

          </div>

          <h4>The Lowdown on these Backcountry Sites</h4>
          <p>Since we arrived late, at 4pm, all 6 of the sites were already taken. We decided to wait by the beach hoping for someone to pack out but we were not lucky. 
            We setup our tents just before dark and camped on the beach. Although this is not technically allowed, we were not going to be able to hike to a further site before dark. No one seemed to 
            mind as we were being pretty respectful on the beach. Since the car is only 7 minute walk away we packed up our food and brought it to the 
            car using our flashlights as a guide instead of tying our stuff in a tree.

          <h2><a name="RabbitBlanketLake">Rabbit Blanket Campground</a></h2>
          <p>On our way back through Lake Superior provincial Park on day 8 we stayed at this small campground on South Old Women River. We managed to get a campsite 
            on the river side for our one night stay, which iâ€™d highly recommend, as we had direct access to the river and could watch the sunset. The campground is pretty 
            long and skinny so campsites are rather close together. Given that though, we found that this was one of the quietest campsites we stayed at. You could hear the 
            odd car from the Highway as we were only ~10 campsites from the Highway but even still, very quiet.</p>

          <h2><a name="KatherineCove">Katherine Cove</a></h2>
          <p>A 23 minute drive down the road from Rabbit Blanket Lake Campground is <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/lakesuperior/activities" target="_blank"> Katherine Cove</a>, a great place for swimming and if you stayed within Lake Superior Provincial Park your parking is already paid for. 
              This is a very popular spot and so if you want parking, try and arrive before 11am. Eventually the parking lot spills onto the side of the road but it's definitely a pretty dangerous place to park. 
              50m from the Katherine Cove Parking lot, there is a beach. Since the highway is pretty visible from it, most people go to the beach just south of the cove which is bigger and further from the Highway. 
              There is 950m trail, clearly marked, that leads you to this next beach. It isn't the easiest trail with 3-4 sections where you are climbing up on tree roots. That being said, there were some pretty young children doing it so it's not impossible. 
              If you don't want to do the trail, we did see cars parked on the side of the Highway, you'll see other cars doing the same thing. 
          </p>

          <p>We decided to grab a spot on the rocks just south of the further beach and have lunch. A really great spot to relax with a view!</p>
